<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>2. How to upload on 1337x?</b></button>
<div class="content">
 <p><strong class="text-strong">STEP 1 - RULES</strong><br /><br />First of all you need to read through the 1337x uploader rules. Its important that you follow the rules to be able to upload. If you rush through reading the rules you are more likely to miss important information and not understand it properly, you would risk getting denied, demoted or banned. So read through the rules carefully the first time rather than getting into trouble afterwards!<br /><br />Link:&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="https://1337x-to.github.io/#rules">Uploader Rules &amp; Guidance</a><br /><br /><br /><strong>STEP 2 - FILL OUT APPLICATION</strong><br /><br />After reading rules and instruction that is understood you will need to obtain&nbsp;<span class="glow">trial-uploader status</span>&nbsp;to start uploading. You will not get trusted&nbsp;<span class="glow">uploader status</span>&nbsp;right away. First you must prove that you are trustworthy as an uploader over time, stable and uploading according to the rules. Therefore, you must first get trial status.<br /><br />Go to&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="https://1337x.to/upload" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://1337x.to/upload</a>&nbsp;or click on&nbsp;UPLOAD&nbsp;as showen in picture below. Read "Upload News" 1- 5 as shown below and provide as mutch information that is required.<br /><br /><br /><img class="postimage" src="https://i.ibb.co/rpFGzwP/1-click-on-upload-fill-out-application.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />After submitting the application, just be patient and wait for a moderator to go through your application. Check your&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="https://1337x.to/notifications/1/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">notifications</a>&nbsp;and your&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="https://1337x.to/mailbox/1/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">inbox</a>&nbsp;after a while.<br /><br /><br /><strong>STEP 3 - LOG INTO CHAT</strong><br /><br />Most people get denied&nbsp;<span class="glow">trial-uploader status</span>&nbsp;at first. Check your&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="https://1337x.to/mailbox/1/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">inbox</a>&nbsp;for pm's from staff. It is correct for you to log into 1337x chat room where you can ask staff directly for help and tell them aboute your situation.<br /><br />Log in to chat room here:&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="https://chat.1337x.to/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://chat.1337x.to/</a><br /><br />Staff will help you as soon they see your message and are available.<br />NB! Do not whisper to staff.<br /><br /><img class="postimage" src="https://i.ibb.co/hyRy6LP/2-come-to-chat.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><strong>STEP 4 - TRIAL-UPLOADER CONFIRMATION</strong><br /><br />Once you have agreed and clarified with staff, you will be promoted to&nbsp;<span class="glow">trial-uploader status</span>. To see that you have been given trial uploader status you can either log out and in chat to see your&nbsp;"username"&nbsp;in red color, or you can see a&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="https://1337x.to/notifications/1/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">notification</a>&nbsp;on your user account. It will look something like the picture below.<br /><br /><img class="postimage" src="https://i.ibb.co/wRhHdtY/3-confirmation-promoted-to-trial.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><strong>STEP 5 - UPLOAD A TORRENT</strong><br /><br />Congratulations! You have now permission to upload. So let's continue and do a upload. You will need to create a torrent file, thats the file that links to your uploading files you wanna share. If you are unfamiliar with how to create a torrent file, I recommend you have a look at a step-by-step guide on&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="faq#crt">How to Create a Torrent</a>&nbsp;or watch&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="https://www.sendvid.com/ltao853b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this video</a>&nbsp;before continuing here.<br /><br />On the site click on&nbsp;UPLOAD&nbsp;as shown in picture below or you can also click here:&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="https://1337x.to/upload" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://1337x.to/upload</a>. You will see the upload site a little different this time. You will now fill out everything on that page like torrent title, browse your torrent file, choose your media language, select correct category/type for your torrent. Lastly make a good and clear torrent description written in your own chosen form with minimum 1 visible screenshot (on movie uploads).<br /><br /><img class="postimage" src="https://i.ibb.co/t3xYV9J/4-click-on-upload-again-fill-out-application.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Now the torrent will be visible on the site immediately and be visible and accessible for others to download.<br /><br />Below are some examples of well acceptable torrent descriptions look like:<br /><a class="postlink" href="https://1337x.to/torrent/4353674/2010-1984-1080p-BluRay-x265-HEVC-10bit-AAC-5-1-Tigole-QxR/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Example 1</a><br /><a class="postlink" href="https://1337x.to/torrent/4708141/Popeye-1980-1080p-BDRip-HEVC-x265-English-AC3-5-1-MeGUiL/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Example 2</a></p>

</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>6. What are common Torrent Terms? </b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p><strong>Torrent:</strong> At the beginning of all this is the torrent file itself. This is the file you search for when you want to download something. Usually, the torrent file name is descriptive enough. For instance, an Ubuntu release can have this file name: ubuntu-17.10-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent</p>
<p>Remember, the .torrent file is not the entire file. It is extremely small and it just contains the information that points to the actual file and the people who are sharing it. It is like a map which is used by the BitTorrent client to assemble all the pieces together.</p>
<p><strong>Torrent client:</strong> A Torrent client is your downloader. It is the piece of software which takes the .torrent file, reads the information in it and starts the download. Torrent clients are available for all platforms including Android and iOS. On the iOS, you may have to jailbreak the phone.</p>
<p><strong>Peer:</strong> A peer is any computer participating in the download and upload of a torrent file.</p>
<p><strong>Seeder:</strong> A seed (or seeder) is anyone who has a complete copy of the file being shared across the torrent network.</p>
<p><strong>Leecher:</strong> A leech (or a leecher) is the person who does not have the complete file yet but has joined the network to download it. A leecher becomes a seeder when he downloads the entire file and then shares it across the network.</p>
<p><strong>Swarm:</strong> The swarm is the sum total of all the leechers and seeders (i.e. all the computers) participating in the torrent process.</p>
<p><strong>Index:</strong> An index is, as the name implies, a searchable list of .torrent files, hosted on a website.</p>
<p><strong>Share ratio:</strong> The ratio is the amount of data a user has uploaded divided by the amount of data they have downloaded for a particular torrent (UL&divide;DL). A share ratio greater than 1 has a positive effect on the user&rsquo;s reputation because it means that the user has sent more data to other users than he has received. Conversely, a share ratio under 1 has a negative effect.</p>
<p><strong>Tracker:</strong> The tracker is a server which has the information of who has what files and who needs which ones, thus acting as a bridge between seeders and leechers. Some trackers are private requiring a registration where most are public.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>7. How Scene Works?</b></button>
<div class="content"><p>Scene aka <a class="postlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez_scene" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">warez scene</a></p>
  <div>
 <img class="postimage" src="https://i.imgur.com/XKZfBdF.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>
<p><br /><br /><br /><span class="glow"><strong class="text-strong">1)</strong>&nbsp;</span>At the top we have the&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_warez_groups" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">release groups</a>.. Such as REVOLT, METCON, CBFM, CRiMSON Etc...<br /><br />-&gt; These groups are sometimes run by few people and sometimes by just an individual person. But not all of these groups release on torrents. Some of these groups hate torrents and anything to do with peer to peer. This is where the real secret trading goes on.<br /><br />-&gt; The Scene has no central leadership, location, or other conventional distinguishing marks of existence, but some general guidelines apply globally, considering the historical usage of the term and the history of the communities the term has been used to represent. These guidelines include a rigid set of rules that groups must follow in releasing pirated stuff.<br /><br />These groups Hate torrents, usenet, rapidshare and all other peer to peer programs such as limewire etc..because such programs expose your Ip's to the public and other anti-piracy organizations and is a big risk for them to expose their members. By not releasing stuff via this method they maintain longevity and secretiveness and a constant supply of warez.<br /><br />So then you ask how come all their stuff is reaching the torrents and forums?<br /><br />This is where the next set of releasers come in.<br /><br /><span class="glow"><strong class="text-strong">2)&nbsp;</strong></span><a class="postlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topsite_%28warez%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Topsites</a>&nbsp;are FTP servers connected to high speed lines minimum 100Mbit to 1Gbit to multi-Gbit. FTP is another way of transferring stuff but much secure as it uses SSL encryption so it is very very hard to snoop around an FTP server.<br /><br />Scene groups use FTP aka Topsites aka Scene sites to trade releases between each other. FTP Sites have trusted users called racers or traders who trade releases from one FTP site to another FTP site.<br /><br />Every FTP site has certain sections on the wish of its owner who owns the servers (eg. TV-XVID, TV-X264, DVDR, XVID, X264, APPS, 0DAY, GAMES, XBOX360, XXX, WII ETC...). These are basically the most important sections but other FTP sites could have foreign sections such as French, Spanish, German, Italian etc depending on the FTP owners nationality and his needs. Each FTP site has it's own rules and every Racer must have to adhere to every FTP sites rule.<br /><br />Why are there rules on FTP sites?<br /><br />Rules are there to maintain consistency and ignore spam and bullshit. IF you don't adhere to the rules you get&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuke_%28warez%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Nuked</a>. What does the term nuked mean?<br /><br />When a racer races he earns credits set according to a certain ratio. For example if the owner of the ftp site sets all racers ratio to 1:4; and say there are 2 racers who race Presonus.Studio.One.Pro.v1.5.0.x86.x64.incl.Keygen-AiR . Say racer1 uploaded 400MB of Studio One and racer2 uploaded 300MB of Studio One for a combined total of 700MB.<br /><br />Then according to the ratio 1:4 racer1 gets 400MB x 4 = 1600MB credits and racer2 gets 300MBx4 =1200MB credits to his account. (MB = Megabyte). Say now the owner doesn't like Studio One or it was packed wrong and nukes both racers 3X. That means racer1 will lose 400 x 3 = 1200MB credits from his account and racer2 will lose 300 x 3 = 900MB credits. When u lose credits and don't have enough a FTP site will delete you as you are of no good<br /><br /><span class="glow"><strong class="text-strong">3)</strong></span>&nbsp;You know why we have such good quality torrents and links on the forums always? Scene is run and maintained by rules for every section! for example: there are rules written by owners of&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_%28warez%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">various groups</a>&nbsp;and approved by other groups to be a certain standard.<br />If Scene groups don't follow these rules thy will get&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuke_%28warez%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">nuked</a>, Its like a university degree, you don't want to have 10 failed courses, then you are not looked as a smart student. Similarly, a group doesn't want too many nukes besides its name. It destroys their reputation and doesn't let them get on good FTP sites<br /><br />Scene groups are known as affils or affiliates when they release on a FTP site. When they release something..racers and traders start racing that release to other FTP sites at Gbit speeds using auto mated scripts.<br /><br />When they Release something on a ftp site it is known as to pred or a pre. pre means the release is ready to be raced to other ftp sites NOT torrent sites. Remember all scene groups hate torrents and do not want ANY of their stuff on torrent sites or forums. If they see someone on their FTP sites releasing stuff on torrents/forums, his/her Ip gets banned and he/she gets NFOed sending a warning to other FTP sites to delete purge him/her and never to allow him/her anywhere near scene ever again.<br /><br />Now you ask, well if the scene groups hate torrent sites so much, how come uploaders are able to release so much stuff from these FTP sites?<br /><br /><span class="glow"><strong class="text-strong">4)</strong></span>&nbsp;Because a few uploaders hide their identity and don't say that they are releasing on torrent sites. Other FTP sites ask for money secretly from p2p uploaders to let them upload to torrent sites. These FTP sites take a risk that if they get busted by other scene groups their ftp site will be NFOed and will be shut down and the owner of that FTP site will be considered supporting P2P or torrents forever and he forever will be banned from Scene. Uploaders have to be very careful in hiding their information so that they don't get caught!<br /><br />What about other groups such as Judas and Erai-raws Etc,...<br /><br /><span class="glow"><strong class="text-strong">5)</strong>&nbsp;</span>These groups are all P2P groups that is they are not scene and these groups release their stuff directly to torrents or as 3rd party server links on some of the forums sites. They have no relationship with FTPs or the Scene.Although they do use a Private FTP network to share with others that upload to sites.Now a proper Scene FTP site is never going to be interested in letting these groups PRE or RELEASE on their FTP sites<br /><br /><span class="glow">In Summary</span>, a release gets&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuke_%28warez%29#Pre_database" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">pred</a>&nbsp;by scene groups on FTP sites and then those releases get traded to other ftp sites from where a few uploaders who hide their identities..upload it to torrents. An UPLOADER has nothing to do with the release itself. He is just a messenger. DO NOT blame the uploader for a faulty release, as it is the groups fault that their release is not up to the mark . Always respect this knowledge, never go around mailing the scene groups if u are a torrent user. That brings unnecessary attention and reveals your lack of knowledge and puts the Uploader as well as the site at risk!!<br /><br />On that note, feel free to discuss this information here Remember this is to gain knowledge and appreciate the warez world. This is not to start demanding stuff, just to appreciate how the entire pirated world works.</p>

<div class="content">
  <p><strong class="text-strong">DNS over HTTPS (DoH)</strong>&nbsp;is a protocol for performing remote Domain Name System (DNS) resolution via the HTTPS protocol. A goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data by man-in-the-middle attacks[1] by using the HTTPS protocol to encrypt the data between the DoH client and the DoH-based DNS resolver. Encryption by itself does not protect privacy, encryption is simply a method to obfuscate the data.

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>10. How to Encode HEVC x265 Using Handbrake ?   </b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p><strong class="text-strong">Hardware Requirements</strong><br />An Intel CPU with hyperthreading and an integrated GPU is highly recommended for this guide. It's ideal to have at least 6 cores and 12 threads. Furthermore, the Windows platform has better support than Linux for features such as QSV which will accelerate decoding.<br /><br /><strong class="text-strong">Download and Install Handbrake</strong><br />Visit the official Handbrake website and get the latest stable release.&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php</a><br /><br /><strong class="text-strong">Configuring Handbrake Client</strong><br />Once installed if you have an iGPU you can enable software accelerated decoding. Go to Tools -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Video.</p>
<p><br /><img class="postimage" src="https://i.imgur.com/mSRKTTN.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><strong class="text-strong">Configuring a Preset to Save Options</strong><br />The first thing a user should do is turn off all the filters, unless they specially need one.</p>
<p><br /><img class="postimage" src="https://i.imgur.com/i2aVrxG.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Then go to the video tab and configure either the "slow" example or the "slower" example. The slower example will take double the encoding time but produce higher quality videos. Whereas, slow will still produce good quality videos if slower is unbearable for you.<br /><br />CRF 18 should be used for Movies. You can go all the way down to 22 for TV-Shows or XXX, if you need better compression. Any higher than CRF 22 is not recommended. Lower numbers will produce higher quality, anything lower than 18 is pointless.<br /><br />With the exception of the advanced options bellow, all settings will use the default x265 presets.<br /><a class="postlink" href="https://x265.readthedocs.io/en/default/presets.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://x265.readthedocs.io/en/default/presets.html</a><br /><br />In this example "slow" the advanced options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>bframes=8: Improves quality and compression efficiency.</li>
<li>rc-lookahead=40: Improves quality. Any higher will have a placebo effect.</li>
<li>no-rect: Greatly improves encoding time with very minimal loss of quality.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="postimage" src="https://i.imgur.com/r9J4Ex1.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />In this example "slower" the advanced options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>max-merge=5: Improves motion quality with very minimal increase to encoding time.</li>
<li>limit-refs=3: Limits the references back to slow values to speed up encoding time.</li>
<li>rd=4: Restores rate distortion optimization back to slow values to cut encoding time in half.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="postimage" src="https://i.imgur.com/vdu90pe.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Afterwards, go to the Dimension tab and add one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>For 480p: Width: 854 Height: 480</li>
<li>For 720p: Width: 1280 Height: 720</li>
<li>For 1080p: Width: 1920 Height 1080</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Summary tab select ether MKV for movies or MP4 other content. Then click the Add button under "presets".<br /><br /><strong class="text-strong">Other Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always use an original source when available. Each time a video is re-encoded, there is a permanent loss of quality.</li>
<li>Preferable to select 4K sources and encode them down to 480p/720p/1080p. This will result in higher quality encodes.</li>
<li>AAC is recommended for audio. It will produce better quality audio than MP3 or AC3. Passthru works the best.</li>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>11. What is a Seedbox & Why do I need it?  </b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Think of a seedbox as the remote computer that you might have in an offshore country where torrenting is legal and you can access this computer remotely from wherever you are in the world.</p>
<p>Just like a web-service e.g. Dropbox has a torrent software interface on your browser through which you can add torrents remotely and later transfer the downloaded content from the remote computer to your PC with encryption so that your ISP cannot detect what you are downloading online.</p>
<p>Not only does this method let you seed your torrents, but it also maintains your privacy and you can access your data from the remote computer anywhere in the world where you have an Internet connection.</p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-US">Speed</span></strong></p>
<p>This is the most common advantage of using a seedbox for storage. It's because most of them are of 100Mbit&nbsp; lines which makes them the fastest. They &lsquo;re faster than the internet that you have in your house. All you need is to do the setup and then relax.</p>
<p>Within a little time, you'll find how easily these torrent files will be accomplished. The files in Gb's can also be downloaded within a minute and without any hurdles.It will significantly boost both upload and download speeds. This is one of the major advantages that can't be experienced by making use of it to this extent.</p>
<p>Security and safety</p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">With this, you can be assured of high-end security and safety as mentioned above. On your PCs, you don't have to use any bit of torrent clients. You don't really need to worry about the MPAA or RIAA spy anymore. And from ISP you won't get any of the warning letters or DMCAA notes. It will give you 100 percent protection entirely.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The only way to guarantee protection is to make use of this application. It is clear that it offers a high-end encryption network for file uploads, which is secure and confidential</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-US">Ratio</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">It is also simple and easy to maintain the ratio with the seedboxes. These basically come with a massive storage device. Using a private tracker, you can download any of your files and leave your file on upload. It requires no further effort, and also maintains ration on site.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">You don't even have to take stress on uploading traffic because it can be done remotely. And, if you're the one who puts tension on the torrent &lsquo;s private trackers over keeping the ratio, then this could be your ideal pick.</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-US">Uploading and downloading</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Even the torrents are less stressed about downloading but are more focused on seeding.The ratio with it can be 1:1. You can pause or delete torrent with the best use of a cheap seedbox, and can even replace it with new ones. Quick and safe downloading or uploading with its best help is the major reason why people go for it.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">As you can see, there are no limitations on uploading or downloading and one can maximize their rate of transfer.One of the main reasons why people go for this system is both uploading and seeding.</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-US">Convenience</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The seedboxes are extremely functional for use. You do not need to use any computer that would eat your data allowance.Don't bother your roommates who frequently access big files, then slow down the internet.What you need to do is set up an inexpensive storage seedbox to read trackers and that will instantly access all of the files.</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-US">Complete prohibition on peer to peer traffic</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Downloads from peer to peer traffic aren't really allowed in many of the places. If ISP is blocked it can be your office, school, or home. It is an alternative that lets you access files quickly and you can use the same at some later time. It comes with an easy-to-use web browser that enables simple file sharing and downloading.Whenever possible it even loads the same onto the computer later.</span></p>

<div class="content">
  <p>A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, allows you to create a secure connection to another network over the Internet. VPNs can be used to access region-restricted websites, shield your browsing activity from prying eyes on public Wi-Fi, and more. VPNs essentially forward all your network traffic to the network, which is where the benefits &ndash; like accessing local network resources remotely and bypassing Internet censorship &ndash; all come from.</p>
<p>VPN works by tunneling your connection through its own encrypted servers, which hides your activity from your ISP and anyone else who might be watching &ndash; including the government and nefarious hackers. This also allows you to access restricted sites, stream a wider range of shows, and avoid network throttling.</p>
<p><strong>You can use a VPN to:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Bypass geographic restrictions on websites or streaming audio and video.</li>
<li>Watch streaming media like Netflix and Hulu.</li>
<li>Protect yourself from snooping on untrustworthy Wi-Fi hotspots.</li>
<li>Gain at least some anonymity online by hiding your true location.</li>
<li>Protect yourself from being logged while torrenting.</li>
