					<p><strong>1337x 2007</strong><br />1337x was started to fill an apparent void where it seemed there was a lack of quality conscience ad free torrent sites. We strive to maintain a community atmosphere with a helpful staff who quickly verify all uploaded content and up-loaders.<br /><br /><strong>1337x 2020-Forever</strong><br />Over the years things have changed slightly. As we grew we introduced ads to the main torrent site but only when not logged in to help with costs. We have also added many more rules. Unfortunately these rules were necessary because people abused our trust and kindness. We have however always maintained a stance of "Sharing is caring" and firmly believe in helping to maintain a safe environment for our users and to help deliver content free from spam and ads. We still maintain a community atmosphere and the heart of that can be found in our chat-room.</p>

<p>In some sections the requirement of a screenshot is mandatory in others it is appreciated but not required. You will find out what sections require them towards the end of this guide. We have a white list of prefered <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="imghost.html">image hosts</a></span></strong>. You do not have to use this but if you are planning on using one not on the list, it must comply with the following conditions.</p>
<p>The image hosting site must not be on the <a href="imghost.html#ban"> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">banned list</strong></a>. No money making image hosts allowed. Any image host where you have to click a link to view the image is also banned. Any image host that pops up ads is also banned. Host ads should be no more than 5 but this will not be strictly enforced so long as the ads are responsible. No ads serving malware. Any hosts with malware ads will be added to the ban list straight away.</p>

<p><br /><strong>3rd party site links</strong></p>
<p>Trial uploaders are no longer allowed to link to any 3rd party site or offsite places in folder names or torrent descriptions. The exception to this is sites like IMDB, TVDB, goodreads and similar sites used for file information.</p>
<p>You are allowed to include a text file inside your torrent with a link to your site.<br />If you are including a text file to a 3rd party site then the siteMUST comply with the following,</p>
<p><strong>No excessive ads</strong><br />Strictly no ads serving malware (You get one chance and one chance only)<br />The site MUST offer .torrent files and not just direct download links and/or file-locker links. (Exceptions - Server / seedbox / vpn providers, subtitle sites, Imdb/Tvbd or anything similar)<br />The site MUST be related to file-sharing or file information.<br />You MUST tell staff if you plan to include a text file link to your site.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">ANY TRIAL UPLOADER THAT BREAKS THESE CONDITION'S LOSES ALL LINKING PRIVILEGES</span> - All torrents will be deleted and you may or may not be allowed to continue to upload with no links.<br />There is no second chances. It is up to you to make sure the site you link to complies with this. If you cannot then do not link to it.</p>
<p>When and if a Trial Uploader is promoted to Trusted Uploader they will be allowed to include links in their descriptions. The linked site still has to comply with the rules above.</p>
<h2 id="section-rule">Section specific rules</h2>
<p id="movies"><br /><strong>Movie uploads</strong></p>
<p>We require a minimum of one visible screenshot in your description for every movie upload. These screenshots are to be from the video you are uploading. Using the same screenshot for 1080p/720p or any different resolution or codec is not appropriate. Cover/Title posters are appreciated but do not count as a screenshot. Movie uploads must not contain any zip, rar or any other file archive formats. Movie torrents are also subject to the universal rules above.</p>
<p id="tv"><strong>Tv, Anime &amp; Documentary uploads</strong></p>
<p>These sections do not require screenshots but screenshots are appreciated. When including screenshots they must comply with our universal rules above. Tv &amp; Anime uploads must not contain any zip, rar or any other file archive formats. Tv &amp; Anime torrents are also subject to the universal rules above. If for some unknown special reason you need to use rar/zip's you must get staff permission.</p>
<p id="other"><strong>Other Section</strong></p>
<p>Uploads in this section must have a description and not just offsite links. Rar/zips are sometimes needed for certain things like plugins etc, Make sure to get staff permission first. Screenshots are welcome but not mandatory. Historically this section has been a bit spammy - Please don't make it worse.</p>
<p id="app-games"><strong>Applications &amp; Game uploads</strong></p>
<p>Anyone wishing to upload software or games will have to prove they are trusted elsewhere. This will ideally be another torrent site but release blogs and other forms of file sharing services might be accepted. We refuse 95% of software uploader applications so be prepared for a refusal. You will also have to demonstrate you have enough knowledge to check software for malware.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the uploader to check software for viruses prior to uploading. If you do not know how to check if a file is clean and what false positives are then either learn first or pick another category to upload in. Sites like Virus Total and Hydrid Analysis are excellent resources. Tools like Virtualbox and VMware are awesome for checking bigger files. You will be expected to demonstrate Staff are not here to check files for you. Staff will however randomly check files of uploaders at all levels. If any are found to have infected files you will be demoted and/or banned.</p>
<p id="xxx"><strong>XXX uploads</strong></p>
<p>We require a minimum of one visible screenshot in your description for every XXX video upload. These screenshots are to be from the video you are uploading. Using the same screenshot for 1080p/720p or any different resolution or codec is not appropriate. Cover/Title posters are appreciated but do not count as a screenshot. XXX uploads must not contain any zip, rar or any other file archive formats.</p>
<p>It is hard to find image hosts that allow porn. Therefore we are a little more forgiving when it comes to the XXX section. Please do not use an image host under the banned list here. We have a white list of preferred XXX image hosts. You are free to use your own host but it must comply with the universal rules above.</p>
